# hacker-bookmarks

### Why?

Are you in the middle of a pentest or a CTF and can’t remember the site to crack a hash? Or do you need to set up a cronjob and the syntax was something like * * * 60 or whatever? Of course — you’re on a VM and have to go to your laptop to copy a bookmarked URL. It happens to me all the time.

I collected all the websites we covered in the 250-hour The Bridge course and put them into a single bookmark. You can clone it with git clone https://github.com/shanickcuello/hacker-bookmarks.git and have everything available on your Kali.

If it helps, feel free to add URLs via a PR.

## How to use it
